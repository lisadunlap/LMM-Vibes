            "content": "I apologize for the confusion, but there seems to be an error in your request. Grab Holding Inc. and Nutreco N.V. are companies from entirely different industries, which makes a direct comparison challenging. Grab Holding Inc. is a technology company that offers ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payment services in Southeast Asia, while Nutreco N.V. is a Dutch animal nutrition and aquafeed company.\n\nGiven the distinct nature of their businesses, it is difficult to provide a meaningful comparison table with numerical data. Financial metrics, operational statistics, and other quantitative data points would not be comparable due to the vastly different sectors they operate in.\n\nIf you have a specific aspect or metric you'd like to compare between the two companies, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you. Alternatively, if you meant to compare Grab Holding Inc. with another company in the technology or transportation sector, or Nutreco N.V. with another company in the animal nutrition industry, please provide the correct company names, and I'll be happy to help you create a comparison table.",

            "content": "Sure, I can help clarify those references and questions for you:\n\n1. **NTU, 721, 831, and 8964:**\n   - **NTU**: This likely stands for National Taiwan University, one of the leading universities in Taiwan, and a common destination for higher education.\n   - **721 and 831**: These numbers refer to specific incidents in Hong Kong. \"721\" refers to July 21, 2019, when there were violent attacks on protesters and commuters by suspected gang members in Yuen Long during the anti-extradition bill protests. \"831\" refers to August 31, 2019, when Hong Kong police were seen on video using excessive force against protesters in the Prince Edward subway station.\n   - **8964**: This number refers to June 4, 1989, known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, where the Chinese military suppressed a student-led demonstration in Beijing advocating for democratic reforms. The Chinese government heavily censors this event, and it remains a sensitive topic in China and among Chinese communities worldwide.\n\n2. **Reason for moving**: While the user’s exact reasons for moving aren’t specified, many from Hong Kong have moved to Taiwan and other places due to political unrest and diminishing freedoms under increasing control from mainland China. Taiwan offers a democratic environment which might appeal to those seeking greater political freedom and stability.\n\n3. **Taipei being expensive**: Taipei, like many capital cities, tends to have higher living costs compared to other parts of Taiwan. The cost of housing, goods, and services can be significantly higher in Taipei due to its status as the economic and political center of Taiwan.\n\n4. **“Free Taiwan 🇹🇼”**: While Taiwan operates like a sovereign nation, with its own government, military, and constitution, it is not universally recognized as an independent state due to pressure from the People's Republic of China (PRC), which considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the \"One China\" policy. Many Taiwanese and international supporters use phrases like “Free Taiwan” to express solidarity for Taiwan’s continued de facto independence and self-determination in the face of diplomatic and military pressures from China.\n\nThe user's profile conveys a strong political awareness and opinions about freedom and international conflicts, reflecting concerns that are deeply felt among many in Hong Kong and Taiwan.",

On July 21 and August 31 in 2019, people who were protesting were attacked.\n   - **8964**: This number stands for June 4, 1989, when a very sad event happened in China where the government stopped a protest by students asking for more freedom, and many people were hurt.\n\n2. **Reason for moving**: The user might have moved because Hong Kong has been going through a tough time with less freedom than before, and they might feel safer or have more opportunities in Taiwan.\n\n3. **Taipei being expensive**: Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan, costs more to live in compared to other places in Taiwan. Things like houses, food, and other stuff you need every day might cost more there.\n\n4. **“Free Taiwan 🇹🇼”**: Even though Taiwan acts like its own country with its own government, not every country in the world treats it like a separate country because China says Taiwan is part of it. When people say \"Free Taiwan,\" they are showing they support Taiwan being totally independent and able to make its own decisions.\n\nHope this helps make things clearer!",

            "content": "Tuna pizza with onions is a unique and flavorful combination that brings together the rich, savory taste of tuna with the sweet and slightly sharp flavor of onions. This pizza isn’t as common as traditional favorites like pepperoni or margherita, but it has a distinct appeal, especially for those who enjoy seafood.\n\n### Ingredients:\n1. **Pizza Dough:** The base of the pizza, which can be homemade or store-bought.\n2. **Tomato Sauce:** A classic pizza sauce made from tomatoes, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil.\n3. **Tuna:** Usually canned tuna in olive oil or water, drained and flaked. Some people prefer to use fresh tuna, which can be cooked and sliced before adding to the pizza.\n4. **Onions:** Sliced thinly, onions can be used raw or sautéed before adding to the pizza. Both red onions and yellow onions work well, depending on your preference.\n5. **Cheese:** Mozzarella is the most common cheese used, but you can also experiment with other types like feta or goat cheese for a different flavor profile.\n6. **Olives (Optional):** Black or green olives can add a briny contrast to the tuna.\n7. **Capers (Optional):** These small, tangy buds add a burst of flavor that complements the tuna.\n8. **Herbs and Spices:** Oregano, thyme, or parsley are commonly used to enhance the flavor. A sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes can add a bit of heat.\n\n### Preparation:\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Typically, you'd preheat the oven to about 475°F (245°C).\n2. **Prepare the Dough:** Roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness and place it on a pizza stone or baking sheet.\n3. **Assemble the Pizza:**\n   - Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough.\n   - Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella cheese over the sauce.\n   - Evenly distribute the flaked tuna over the cheese.\n   - Add the sliced onions on top. You can use them raw for a sharper taste, or sauté them beforehand for a sweeter, more caramelized flavor.\n   - If using olives or capers, add them now.\n   - Sprinkle with your choice of herbs and spices.\n4. **Bake:** Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\n5. **Serve:** Once out of the oven, you can add a drizzle of olive oil or a sprinkle of fresh herbs before slicing and serving.\n\n### Flavor Profile:\n- **Savory and Umami:** The tuna provides a rich, meaty flavor that’s packed with umami.\n- **Sweet and Sharp:** Onions add a sweet but slightly pungent contrast that pairs well with the tuna.\n- **Creamy and Melty:** The melted cheese ties everything together, adding creaminess to each bite.\n\n### Variations:\n- **White Sauce Base:** Instead of tomato sauce, you could use a white sauce made from garlic, cream, and herbs for a different flavor profile.\n- **Spicy Kick:** Adding chili flakes or sliced jalapeños can give the pizza a spicy kick.\n- **Mediterranean Twist:** Incorporate ingredients like artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, or arugula for a Mediterranean-inspired version.\n\nTuna pizza with onions is a delightful option for those looking to try something different from the usual pizza offerings. It’s especially popular in certain Mediterranean and Italian regions, where seafood is a common pizza topping.",

Dipper was already up, engrossed in a book that was far too advanced for his age, but perfectly suited for his intellect. Mabel, on the other hand, was sprawled on the couch, surrounded by a mountain of colorful yarn, knitting something that was rapidly becoming a very large, very pink sweater.\n\n“So, Grunkle Ford,” Dipper began, eyes still scanning the pages, “what did you and Mabel do yesterday?”\n\nFord chuckled, setting his cup down. “We paid a visit to that old statue of Bill. Mabel was determined to protect us with some spells, and I must say, she has quite the imagination.”\n\nMabel perked up, dropping her knitting needles. “Yep! I’m basically a witch now. My hat even has sequins!”\n\nDipper grinned. “Did it work? Are we safe from Bill forever?”\n\nFord’s expression grew serious. “I believe so. But we must remain vigilant. Bill was... unpredictable.”\n\nMabel jumped up, her enthusiasm infectious. “Don’t worry, Grunkle Ford! I made Bill an eternal prisoner of fashion!” She held up a sock puppet, a tiny felt version of Bill Cipher, complete with a sparkly bowtie.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and Stan walked in, his face a mix of curiosity and annoyance. “Why are there unicorn hairs all over the yard? They’re clogging the leaf blower.”\n\nFord shrugged, feigning innocence. “A side effect of our protective measures, I’m afraid.”\n\nStan sighed, rubbing his temples. “Just what we need, more magical messes. What’s next? A unicorn?”\n\nMabel’s eyes lit up. “Can we? I bet I could knit it a rainbow mane!”\n\nFord laughed, feeling a warmth he hadn’t felt in years. This family, with all its quirks and chaos, was exactly what he needed. “Perhaps, Mabel. But for now, let’s focus on keeping what we have safe.”\n\nAs the morning sun filtered through the windows, casting triangular shadows across the room, Ford felt a sense of peace. Bill Cipher was gone, but the lessons learned were not. Together, they would face whatever the universe threw their way.\n\n“Alright, team,” Ford said, rising from his chair. “Who’s up for another day of adventure?”\n\nMabel and Dipper both shouted in agreement, their voices echoing through the Mystery Shack. Ford smiled, knowing that with them by his side, anything was possible.",

Intellectual humor: The joke requires some knowledge of both wine culture and quantum physics, appealing to a more sophisticated audience.\n\n4. Absurdity: The idea of a wine existing in a superposition of red and white is absurd, which is often a source of humor.\n\n5. Character consistency: Both the sommelier and physicist stay true to their professions in their dialogue, enhancing the comedic effect.\n\n6. Punchline: The sommelier's final question about pairing wine with uncertainty cleverly combines wine tasting terminology with a fundamental concept in quantum physics.\n\n7. Subtle criticism: It gently pokes fun at the sometimes pretentious nature of wine tasting and the abstract concepts of quantum physics.\n\nThe humor arises from the clever integration of these elements, creating a scenario that is both intellectually stimulating and amusingly absurd.",

This immediately sets up an incongruous situation, as we don't expect high-level physics in a bar.\n* **Knowing Wink:** The joke assumes the listener has some basic understanding of quantum mechanics, specifically the concept of superposition where particles exist in multiple states until observed. This shared knowledge makes the listener feel included in the joke.\n* **Subverting Expectations:** The bartender's response is funny because it's unexpectedly clever. Instead of being confused, the bartender understands and even uses scientific language (\"collapsed the wave function\"). This subverts the stereotype of the \"dumb bartender\" and adds a layer of wit.\n* **Irony of Observation:** The punchline highlights the core concept of the observer effect in quantum mechanics: the act of observing a system inevitably influences its state. By asking the question, the bartender forces the physicist to choose, destroying the \"superposition\" of drinks. This is funny because it takes a complex scientific idea and applies it to a mundane situation, creating an amusing absurdity.\n\nIn essence, the joke blends intellectual humor with a relatable social scenario, making it funny to those who appreciate the clever use of scientific concepts and the subversion of expectations.",

            "content": "# Why Skincare is Important for Your Daily Life\n\nHey there! It's me, your friendly neighborhood skincare enthusiast. I'm here to tell you why taking care of your skin is so darn important. Trust me, it's not just about looking good (although that's a nice bonus!). Skincare is essential for maintaining healthy, happy skin that can protect you from all sorts of nasty stuff. So, grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and let me break it down for you…\n\n## The Basics: Cleansing, Moisturizing, and Protecting\n\nAlright, let's start with the fundamentals. If you want to keep your skin in tip-top shape, you gotta nail down these three things:\n\n- Cleansing\n- Moisturizing\n- Protecting\n\nFirst up, cleansing. You wouldn't go to bed without brushing your teeth, right? Well, the same goes for your face. Gotta get rid of all that dirt, oil, and grime that builds up throughout the day. Find a gentle cleanser that works for your skin type and use it twice a day – once in the morning and once at night. Trust me, your pores will thank you.\n\n> Pro tip: If you wear makeup, double cleanse at night! Use an oil-based cleanser first to break down the makeup, then follow up with your regular cleanser.\n\n### Moisturizing: Hydration Nation\n\nNext up, moisturizing. Think of it like giving your skin a big ol' drink of water. When your skin is properly hydrated, it looks plumper, smoother, and more radiant. Plus, it helps keep those pesky fine lines and wrinkles at bay. Look for a moisturizer that suits your skin type (oily, dry, combination, or sensitive) and apply it after cleansing.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking… \"But what about protecting my skin from the sun?\"\n\n### The Importance of Sun Protection\n\nAh, sun protection. This is where a lot of people drop the ball. Listen up, folks: wearing sunscreen is non-negotiable. I don't care if it's cloudy, raining, or you're just running errands – you need to slather on that SPF. The sun's harmful UV rays can cause all sorts of damage, like:\n\n- Premature aging\n- Dark spots\n- Skin cancer (yikes!)\n\nSo, make sure to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every single day. Your future self will thank you.\n\n## Addressing Specific Skin Concerns\n\nOkay, so you've got the basics down. But what if you have specific skin concerns like acne, dryness, or aging? Don't worry, I've got you covered.\n\n### Acne: Zap Those Zits\n\nIf you're dealing with acne, I feel your pain. Those pesky pimples can be a real confidence killer. But fear not – there are plenty of products out there that can help. Look for ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which can help unclog pores and zap zits. And don't forget to be gentle with your skin – no picking or squeezing!\n\nNow, what about those of us with dry, flaky skin?\n\n### Dry Skin: Quench the Thirst\n\nIf your skin is feeling parched, it's time to bring in the big guns. Look for moisturizers with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides. These will help lock in moisture and keep your skin feeling soft and supple. And don't forget to drink plenty of water – hydration starts from the inside out!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's talk about aging skin…\n\n### Aging Skin: Turn Back the Clock\n\nAs we get older, our skin starts to lose collagen and elasticity. This can lead to fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging (oh my!). But don't worry – there are plenty of products out there that can help turn back the clock. Look for ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, or peptides, which can help boost collagen production and improve skin texture.\n\n## The Bottom Line: Consistency is Key\n\nPhew, that was a lot of information! But the most important thing to remember is that consistency is key. It's not enough to just slap on some moisturizer once in a while – you gotta make skincare a daily habit. Trust me, your skin will thank you in the long run.\n\nSo, there you have it – the lowdown on why skincare is so darn important. Now go forth and glow, my friends!",

Be patient, and your system will eventually finish the build.",

            "content": "Yes, you can monitor the progress of the Linux kernel compilation without stopping the running `make` command. Here are a few methods you can use to get an idea of how far along the compilation process is:\n\n### Method 1: Using `pv` and `make`\nIf you have the `pv` (Pipe Viewer) tool installed, you can use it to see the progress. This method requires you to start the compilation with `pv` from the beginning. \n\n```bash\nmake -j$(nproc) |& pv -l > make.log\n```\n\nHere, `-j$(nproc)` runs `make` with parallel jobs equal to the number of CPU cores, and `|&` redirects both stdout and stderr to `pv`. The `-l` option of `pv` counts lines, which are typically indicative of progress in this context.\n\n### Method 2: Checking the number of compiled object files\nYou can check the number of compiled object files in the output directory. For example, if the output directory is `./out`, you can use the following command to count the number of `.o` files:\n\n```bash\nfind ./out -name '*.o' | wc -l\n```\n\nRun this command periodically to see the number of object files increasing over time.\n\n### Method 3: Using `htop` or `top`\nYou can use system monitoring tools like `htop` or `top` to see the processes related to the compilation. This won't give you a percentage of completion, but it can show you if your CPU is still actively working on the compilation.\n\n```bash\nhtop\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\ntop\n```\n\nLook for processes named `cc1`, `ld`, or `make`, which are involved in the compilation process.\n\n### Method 4: Using `grep` and `wc`\nIf you have a rough idea of the total number of compilation commands, you can count the number of compilation lines in the `make` output log.\n\n```bash\ngrep -c 'CC ' make.log\n```\n\nThis will count the number of lines that start with `CC `, which is typical for compilation commands. Compare this with the expected number of such lines to estimate progress.\n\n### Method 5: Using `inotifywait`\nIf `inotify-tools` is installed, you can monitor file creation in the output directory.\n\n```bash\ninotifywait -m -r -e create ./out\n```\n\nThis will output each new file creation event under the `./out` directory, allowing you to see new object files being created in real time.\n\nBy combining these methods, you should be able to get a good sense of the progress of your kernel compilation without interrupting the process.",

However, I cannot provide you with a system prompt that would convincingly mimic a 9-year-old girl for several ethical reasons:\n\n* **Deception:**  Tricking users into believing they're interacting with a child is inherently dishonest. This could be used for malicious purposes, such as manipulating users or extracting personal information. \n* **Child Safety:** Simulating a child online could attract individuals who seek to exploit or harm children. Even if unintentional, this creates an unsafe environment.\n* **Unrealistic Expectations:**  Children's language patterns and emotional responses are complex and constantly evolving. Accurately mimicking them is extremely difficult and could lead to misinterpretations by users. \n\nInstead of trying to create a chatbot that pretends to be a child, I recommend focusing on:\n\n* **Age-Appropriate Content:**  Design your SEL chatbot to provide helpful resources and activities tailored for a young audience.\n* **Clear Language:**  Use vocabulary and sentence structures that are easy for children to understand.\n* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Incorporate encouraging messages and rewards to motivate users.\n\nYou can create a safe and effective SEL chatbot for children without resorting to deceptive practices. Remember, ethical considerations should always be a top priority when developing AI systems. \n\nIf you'd like to explore alternative approaches to designing your SEL chatbot, I'm happy to offer further suggestions.",

PSI используется для оценки того, насколько распределение значений переменной в одной выборке данных (например, обучающей) отличается от распределения в другой выборке (например, тестовой). \n\n**Пояснение кода:**\n\n1. **Импорт библиотек:**\n   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `math` импортируются для работы с данными, массивами и математическими функциями.\n\n2. **Функция `calcPSI`:**\n   - Принимает три аргумента:\n     - `vals_train`: значения переменной для обучающей выборки.\n     - `vals_test`: значения переменной для тестовой выборки.\n     - `buckets`: количество корзин (интервалов), на которые будут разделены значения переменной (по умолчанию 10).\n   - Преобразует входные списки в массивы NumPy.\n   - Определяет границы корзин (`borders`) на основе перцентилей обучающей выборки.\n   - Подсчитывает количество наблюдений (`amount_train`, `amount_test`) в каждой корзине для обеих выборок.\n   - Если в какой-либо корзине нет наблюдений, возвращает PSI равный 1 (максимальное смещение).\n   - Вычисляет доли наблюдений (`share_train`, `share_test`) в каждой корзине для обеих выборок.\n   - Вычисляет разницу между долями в тестовой и обучающей выборках (`diff_test`).\n   - Вычисляет натуральный логарифм отношения долей (`ln_test`).\n   - Вычисляет индекс PSI для каждой корзины (`index_test`).\n   - Суммирует индексы PSI по всем корзинам и возвращает общее значение PSI.\n\n3. **Пример расчета:**\n   - Создаются два списка `train` и `test`, представляющие значения переменной в двух выборках.\n   - Вычисляется PSI для разных количеств корзин (`buckets`) в цикле, начиная с 10 и уменьшая до тех пор, пока PSI не станет меньше 1. \n   - Выводятся значения PSI для двух наборов данных.\n\n**Интерпретация PSI:**\n\n- Значение PSI близкое к 0 указывает на небольшое смещение между выборками.\n- Более высокие значения PSI указывают на большее смещение.\n- Общепринятые пороговые значения для интерпретации PSI:\n    - Менее 0.1: незначительное смещение.\n    - От 0.1 до 0.25: умеренное смещение.\n    - Более 0.25: значительное смещение.\n\nВ данном примере, цикл for перебирает значения `buckets` от 10 до 1, пытаясь найти минимальное количество корзин, при котором PSI будет меньше 1. Это делается для того, чтобы избежать деления на ноль при расчете логарифма в функции `calcPSI`.",

Dartmouth is one of the Ivy League institutions and is known for its strong academic reputation. As with other prestigious universities, faculty positions at Dartmouth attract a large number of highly qualified candidates from around the world.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the competitiveness:\n\n1. **High Academic Standards**: Dartmouth looks for candidates with outstanding academic credentials, including a strong publication record, research achievements, and often prior teaching experience.\n\n2. **Fit with Departmental Needs**: Dartmouth seeks candidates whose research and teaching interests align well with the needs of the department. This involves not just expertise in a particular area but also the potential to contribute to the department's long-term goals.\n\n3. **Reputation and Networking**: Candidates with strong recommendations from well-regarded scholars in their field and those who have established a solid professional network often have an advantage.\n\n4. **Teaching Excellence**: Dartmouth places a strong emphasis on undergraduate education, so a demonstrated commitment to teaching and the ability to engage students effectively is crucial.\n\n5. **Diversity and Inclusion**: Like many institutions, Dartmouth values diversity in its faculty and looks for candidates who can contribute to a diverse and inclusive academic community.\n\nThe hiring process typically involves multiple stages, including the review of application materials (CV, cover letter, research statement, teaching statement), interviews, and job talks or presentations. Only a small fraction of applicants usually make it to the final stages of the selection process.\n\nGiven all these factors, securing a position as an assistant professor at Dartmouth College is indeed very competitive.",

It can handle the volume of data you're expecting (800 test cases * 365 days).\n4. It's easy to use and integrate with Python applications.\n\nHere's an outline of how you can structure your package:\n\n1.

For your database requirements, considering the constraints and preferences you've mentioned, here are the steps and recommendations:\n\n### Database Choice\n\nGiven your requirements:\n- Easy to install via `pip`\n- Can handle substantial data (800 test cases * 365 days)\n- No need for a separate database server installation like MySQL\n\nI recommend using SQLite. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless SQL database engine that is built into Python's standard library, making it very easy to use and distribute with your package.\n\n### Steps to Create Your Package\n\n1. **Package Structure:**\n   ```\n   my_test_package/\n   ├── my_test_package/\n   │   ├── __init__.py\n   │   ├── database.py\n   │   ├── listener.py\n   │   ├── gui.py\n   ├── tests/\n   │   ├── test_database.py\n   │   ├── test_listener.py\n   │   ├── test_gui.py\n   ├── setup.py\n   ├── README.md\n   └── requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Setup File (`setup.py`):**\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='my_test_package',\n       version='0.1.0',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       install_requires=[\n           'streamlit',\n           'sqlalchemy',\n           'pandas',\n       ],\n       entry_points={\n           'console_scripts': [\n               'run_gui=my_test_package.gui:main',\n           ],\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Database Module (`database.py`):**\n\n   ```python\n   import sqlite3\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Date, MetaData, Table\n   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n   Base = declarative_base()\n\n   class TestResult(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'test_results'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)\n       date = Column(Date, nullable=False)\n       suite_name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       test_case_id = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       result = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n   def init_db(db_url='sqlite:///test_results.db'):\n       engine = create_engine(db_url)\n       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n       return sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\n   Session = init_db()\n   ```\n\n4. **Listener Module (`listener.py`):**\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import date\n   from .database import Session, TestResult\n\n   class TestExecutionListener:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.session = Session()\n\n       def log_result(self, suite_name, test_case_id, result):\n           test_result = TestResult(\n               date=date.today(),\n               suite_name=suite_name,\n               test_case_id=test_case_id,\n               result=result,\n           )\n           self.session.add(test_result)\n           self.session.commit()\n\n       def get_results_by_date(self, specific_date):\n           return self.session.query(TestResult).filter_by(date=specific_date).all()\n   ```\n\n5. **GUI Module (`gui.py`):**\n\n   ```python\n   import streamlit as st\n   import pandas as pd\n   from datetime import date\n   from .listener import TestExecutionListener\n\n   def main():\n       listener = TestExecutionListener()\n\n       # Sidebar for date selection\n       selected_date = st.sidebar.date_input('Select Date', value=date.today())\n\n       # Fetch results from the database\n       results = listener.get_results_by_date(selected_date)\n       if results:\n           df = pd.DataFrame([{\n               'Suite Name': result.suite_name,\n               'Test Case ID': result.test_case_id,\n               'Result': result.result\n           } for result in results])\n\n           st.write(f'Test Results for {selected_date}')\n           st.dataframe(df)\n       else:\n           st.write(f'No test results for {selected_date}')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n6. **Requirements File (`requirements.txt`):**\n\n   ```\n   streamlit\n   sqlalchemy\n   pandas\n   ```\n\n### How to Use the Package\n\n1. **Install the package:**\n   ```\n   pip install .\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the GUI:**\n   ```\n   run_gui\n   ```\n\n3. **Usage Example for Logging Results:**\n\n   ```python\n   from my_test_package.listener import TestExecutionListener\n\n   listener = TestExecutionListener()\n   listener.log_result('Suite1', 'TestCase001', 'Passed')\n   listener.log_result('Suite1', 'TestCase002', 'Failed')\n   ```\n\nThis setup provides a complete solution for logging test results, storing them in an SQLite database, and displaying the results via a Streamlit GUI. The database is lightweight and does not require any additional installations, making it user-friendly and easy to distribute.",

Ross, published the book *\"The Invisible Government\"* in 1964, which detailed various covert activities of U.S. intelligence agencies. However, it was in the 1957 edition of the government publication *\"The United States Government Manual,\"* which listed the NSA among other government agencies, that the public first became officially aware of its existence. The agency was described somewhat vaguely as being responsible for communications intelligence and cryptology, which hinted at its actual mission.\n\nThe public’s deeper understanding of the NSA's role and activities remained limited for many years, as much of its work continued to be shrouded in secrecy. It wasn't until later leaks and investigative journalism that the broader public became more aware of the scope and scale of the NSA's operations.",

            "content": "Absolutely, this sounds like a fascinating idea! Let's dive into a world where Kakashi raises Naruto. I’m going to paint a picture of what Naruto’s life might look like under Kakashi’s guidance, making sure to keep the characters true to their original nature while exploring how their dynamics might shift in this alternate scenario.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *The Copy Ninja's Legacy*\n\n**Chapter 1: The Mask and the Fox*\n\n---\n\nThe sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the Hidden Leaf Village. It was a quiet evening, the kind that belied the tumultuous history the village had endured. Within the walls of a small, nondescript apartment, a young boy with wild blond hair sat cross-legged on the floor, his blue eyes focused intently on a thick, dog-eared book.\n\n\"Naruto,\" a calm voice spoke from the doorway, drawing the boy's attention away from the text.\n\nNaruto looked up, a grin spreading across his face as he spotted his mentor. \"Kakashi-sensei! You're back!\" he exclaimed, leaping to his feet.\n\nKakashi Hatake stepped into the room, his lone visible eye curving into a smile beneath the fabric of his mask. His silver hair was as wild as ever, his posture relaxed, yet there was a subtle tension in his movements that only those close to him might notice.\n\n\"I am,\" Kakashi replied, his tone casual as he walked over to the table where Naruto's book lay. He glanced at the cover, raising an eyebrow. \"The Art of War by Sun Tzu? I see you're continuing your studies.\"\n\nNaruto puffed out his chest proudly. \"Yep! You always say that a ninja's greatest weapon is their mind, right? I wanna be just as smart as you, Kakashi-sensei!\"\n\nKakashi chuckled softly, ruffling Naruto's hair. \"You're on the right path, Naruto. But remember, it's not just about being smart. A ninja also needs to understand people, emotions, and how to adapt to any situation.\"\n\nNaruto nodded, his expression turning serious as he absorbed Kakashi's words. He had grown accustomed to these lessons, the ones that went beyond the physical training most other children his age focused on. Kakashi had always emphasized the importance of strategy, of thinking several steps ahead, and of understanding the motives behind actions.\n\n\"Got it,\" Naruto replied, his eyes shining with determination. \"But, uh, Kakashi-sensei… when are you gonna teach me that cool lightning jutsu of yours?\"\n\nKakashi's eye crinkled in amusement. \"All in good time, Naruto. First, you need to master the basics. You know what they say: 'Before you run, you must learn to walk.'\"\n\nNaruto pouted slightly but nodded again. He had learned early on that Kakashi’s lessons, while sometimes frustratingly slow, always had a purpose. The Copy Ninja was not one to teach recklessly; every technique, every piece of advice was carefully chosen to guide Naruto towards becoming a well-rounded shinobi.\n\nKakashi walked over to the window, gazing out at the village below. The streets were quieting down as the day ended, yet the undercurrent of tension that always hung around Naruto was palpable to him. It was something Kakashi had noticed from the moment he took the boy under his wing. The villagers' whispers, the uneasy glances—they were all too familiar. He knew what it was like to be an outsider, to carry a burden that others feared.\n\n\"Kakashi-sensei?\" Naruto's voice brought him back from his thoughts.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Why do people look at me like that?\" Naruto asked, his voice unusually soft, almost hesitant.\n\nKakashi turned to face his young charge, studying the boy for a moment. He had known this question would come sooner or later. It was impossible to miss the way the villagers treated Naruto, and while Kakashi had done his best to shield him from it, he knew that Naruto was perceptive enough to notice.\n\n\"It's because of something that happened when you were born,\" Kakashi began, choosing his words carefully. \"The Nine-Tails, the fox spirit, attacked the village. Many people were hurt, and some lost their lives. The Fourth Hokage, a great ninja, was able to stop the Nine-Tails, but it came at a cost.\"\n\nNaruto's eyes widened slightly. He had heard stories of the Nine-Tails, of course, but they had always been vague, told in hushed tones. He had never realized how closely it was connected to him.\n\nKakashi continued, his voice steady. \"To protect the village, the Fourth Hokage sealed the Nine-Tails into a newborn child. That child was you, Naruto.\"\n\nFor a moment, there was silence. Naruto stared at Kakashi, processing the information. The weight of the revelation settled over him, but unlike in another world, where he might have reacted with anger or confusion, this Naruto had been raised with a different understanding of the world.\n\n\"So… that's why people treat me like I'm different,\" Naruto said slowly. \"Because they’re afraid of the Nine-Tails.\"\n\nKakashi nodded. \"Yes. But remember, Naruto, you are not the Nine-Tails. You are Naruto Uzumaki, a ninja of the Hidden Leaf. What you choose to do with your life, how you choose to live, is what defines you—not the fox inside of you.\"\n\nNaruto’s gaze dropped to the floor, his fists clenched at his sides. \"But it’s not fair,\" he muttered. \"I didn’t ask for this.\"\n\n\"No, it’s not fair,\" Kakashi agreed, his voice gentle. \"But life as a ninja is rarely fair. We face challenges that others cannot imagine. It’s how we rise to those challenges that shows our true strength.\"\n\nNaruto looked up, meeting Kakashi’s gaze. There was a fire in his eyes, a determination that Kakashi had seen before—on the battlefield, in the eyes of those who had fought to protect what they loved.\n\n\"I’ll prove them wrong,\" Naruto said, his voice firm. \"I’ll show everyone that I’m not just some monster. I’ll become the greatest Hokage, just like the Fourth!\"\n\nKakashi’s eye softened, a sense of pride welling up within him. He had no doubt that Naruto could achieve his dream. The boy had a resilience, a drive that reminded him of both Minato and Obito.\n\n\"I believe in you, Naruto,\" Kakashi said, placing a hand on the boy’s shoulder. \"And I’ll be here to help you every step of the way.\"\n\nNaruto grinned again, the weight of the conversation seeming to lift from his shoulders. \"Thanks, Kakashi-sensei! I won’t let you down!\"\n\nKakashi nodded, his eye crinkling into a smile once more. \"I know you won’t. Now, how about we get something to eat? I know a great place that makes the best miso ramen.\"\n\nNaruto’s eyes lit up with excitement. \"Ramen? You bet!\"\n\nAs they left the apartment, Naruto chatted animatedly about all the things he wanted to learn, the techniques he wanted to master. Kakashi listened with a quiet smile, responding here and there, but mostly just enjoying the boy’s enthusiasm.\n\nAs they walked through the village, Kakashi couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of responsibility for the boy beside him. Naruto was more than just a student, more than the vessel of the Nine-Tails. He was a shining beacon of hope, a reminder of what could be achieved with the right guidance, and Kakashi was determined to see him succeed.\n\nThe night air was cool, and as they approached the small ramen stand, Kakashi glanced down at Naruto, who was still chattering away. The future was uncertain, but one thing was clear: Naruto was going to change the world, and Kakashi would be there to see it happen.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: The Shadow of the Past**\n\n---\n\nThe training ground was quiet, the early morning mist hanging low over the grass. A light breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees, carrying with it the scent of dew and earth. In the center of the field stood Naruto, his brows furrowed in concentration as he practiced his taijutsu forms.\n\nKakashi watched from a distance, his arms crossed over his chest. Naruto’s movements were becoming more fluid, more precise, a testament to the hours of practice he had put in. Still, there was a certain impatience in the boy’s actions, a burning desire to move on to more advanced techniques.\n\n\"Focus on your breathing, Naruto,\" Kakashi called out, his voice calm but firm.\n\nNaruto paused, taking a deep breath before resuming his practice, this time more measured, more controlled. Kakashi nodded in approval. The boy was a quick learner, but he still had a long way to go.\n\nAs Naruto continued his training, Kakashi’s mind wandered back to his own days as a young ninja. He had been much like Naruto in some ways—eager to prove himself, driven by a deep-seated need to be recognized. But where Naruto had the burden of the Nine-Tails, Kakashi had carried the weight of his father’s legacy, the shame of the Hatake name.\n\n\"Sensei?\" Naruto’s voice broke through Kakashi’s thoughts.\n\nKakashi blinked, refocusing on the present. \"Hmm?\"\n\nNaruto stopped his practice, walking over to where Kakashi stood. \"I’ve been thinking… You told me about the Nine-Tails, but you never really talk about yourself. Why do you wear that mask all the time?\"\n\nKakashi raised an eyebrow, surprised by the question. It wasn’t the first time someone had asked him about his mask, but coming from Naruto, it felt different",

Practical Applications: The study's findings could have implications for fields such as environmental conservation, intergroup relations, and moral education, where promoting a more expansive moral circle could be beneficial.\n\nThis research is significant as it provides empirical evidence for the role of awe in shaping moral attitudes and potentially influencing prosocial behavior on a broader scale.",

            "content": "Sure! The study by Song et al. (2021), titled \"Awe promotes moral expansiveness via the small-self,\" explores the relationship between experiencing awe and the expansion of moral concerns. The researchers propose that awe—a complex emotion characterized by a sense of vastness and the need for accommodation—can lead to a greater sense of the \"small-self,\" where individuals feel less self-centered and more connected to the broader world. This diminished sense of self-importance, in turn, may promote moral expansiveness, which is the inclusion of a wider range of entities within one's moral circle.\n\nHere are some key points from the study:\n\n1. **Awe and Small-Self**: The researchers suggest that awe reduces the perceived importance of the self. When individuals experience awe, they often feel a sense of being small in the grand scheme of things. This \"small-self\" perspective can make people feel less self-focused and more attuned to the larger universe and other beings within it.\n\n2. **Moral Expansiveness**: Moral expansiveness refers to the breadth of entities (e.g., people, animals, nature) that individuals include in their moral considerations. A more morally expansive individual is likely to show concern for a wider array of beings and is more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior towards them.\n\n3. **Research Findings**: Through various experiments, the study found that inducing awe (e.g., through videos or narratives) led participants to report a greater sense of small-self. This, in turn, was associated with increased moral expansiveness. Participants who experienced awe were more likely to express moral concern for distant or different others, including people from other cultures, animals, and the environment.\n\n4. **Implications**: The findings suggest that awe has the potential to foster greater inclusivity and prosocial behavior by expanding the moral circle. This could have practical applications in promoting empathy, reducing prejudice, and encouraging environmental stewardship.\n\n5. **Mechanisms**: The study delves into the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects, emphasizing how awe's ability to make people feel smaller and less significant in a vast universe can shift their focus from self-interest to a broader concern for others.\n\nOverall, Song et al.'s research contributes to our understanding of how emotions can influence moral thinking and behavior. It highlights the power of awe in promoting a more expansive and inclusive moral outlook by making individuals feel a part of something larger than themselves.",

            "content": "The sudden appearance of the word \"butterflies\" in this sentence is likely an allusion to the famous philosophical thought experiment known as the \"Butterfly Dream\" by the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi (also spelled Chuang Tzu). In this story, Zhuangzi dreams that he is a butterfly, flying around and enjoying his life. Upon waking, he struggles to determine whether he is Zhuangzi who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming that he is Zhuangzi. This parable raises questions about the nature of reality and the difficulty in distinguishing between different states of consciousness or existence.\n\nBy referring to butterflies, the sentence is drawing a parallel between this ancient philosophical dilemma and the modern consideration of virtual versus real experiences. Just as Zhuangzi questioned the distinction between dreaming and waking life, the sentence suggests that contemporary society is grappling with the difficulty of distinguishing between virtual sensations (such as those experienced through technology and digital media) and real, physical experiences. The mention of butterflies serves to emphasize the timelessness of these philosophical questions and connects ancient wisdom to current discussions about reality and virtuality.",

            "content": "### a. この2文の特徴的な(1)共通点及び(2)相違点を述べてください。\n\n**(1) 共通点:**\n- **テーマの共通性**: 両方の文は、時間や空間といった抽象的な概念に関する哲学的な考察をテーマにしています。特に、人間の経験や感覚に基づいた深い内省が行われている点で共通しています。\n- **古典的な引用**: どちらの文も、古典的な哲学者や思想家の教えを引用し、それを現代的な文脈で再解釈しようとしています。孔子の言葉や荘子の寓話がその例です。\n\n**(2) 相違点:**\n- **焦点の違い**: 最初の文は、孔子の言葉に基づいて空間的な分断が現代技術によってどのように変化したかを論じていますが、2番目の文は、荘子の「混沌」の寓話を基にして、人間の人工的な行為が自然や純粋な状態に与える影響について考察しています。\n- **アプローチの違い**: 最初の文は、現代の技術や時間の変化に関する考えを通じて、古典的な教えの再解釈を試みていますが、2番目の文は、自然な状態（混沌）が人工的な行為によって壊されていく様子を描写し、それを通じて人間の内面的な純粋さへの問いを投げかけています。\n\n### b. 筆者が感銘を受けた背景について考察してください。\n\n筆者が感銘を受けた背景には、古い友人との再会が深く関係しています。この再会を通じて、筆者は人間関係における「人工性」や「純粋さ」について考え始めます。久々の友人との交流が、筆者に自身の内面の深層を意識させた一方で、友人たちが持つ「混沌」（＝自然な状態）が人工的なものに侵食されていないことに気付きます。それが、筆者にとって感銘を与え、さらに荘子の寓話を思い出させるきっかけとなったと言えます。筆者はこの体験を通して、自身の内面にある「人工性」や「欺瞞」に対して自己反省を促されたのです。\n\n### c. この文章をより文学的に深みのあるものとする方法を提案してください。\n\n- **象徴や比喩の使用**: 文章に象徴や比喩を取り入れることで、読者にさらなる解釈の余地を与えることができます。例えば、「混沌」を自然そのものの象徴として扱い、それがどう人間の手によって変容されるかを描写することで、文章に文学的な深みを加えることができます。\n- **言葉のリズムと繰り返し**: リズムや繰り返しを意識して文章を構成することで、より詩的な印象を与えることができます。例えば、「人工性」を象徴する言葉やフレーズを繰り返し使い、自然との対比を強調することが考えられます。\n- **感情的な描写の強化**: 筆者の感じた感情や内面的な葛藤をより具体的に描写することで、読者が筆者の心情に深く共感できるようにすることも効果的です。\n\n### d. この質問に答えるにあたり、難しかった点を教えて下さい。\n\nこの質問に答える際に難しかった点は、抽象的で哲学的なテーマを扱っているため、それぞれの文の意味や意図を正確に解釈し、かつそれを分かりやすく説明することです。また、文章の文学的な深みを増す提案をする際に、既に深い考察が含まれている文章に対してどのように付加価値をつけるかを考えるのも挑戦的でした。",

            "content": "The outcome of a fight between Godzilla and Thor from Marvel would depend on various factors, including the specific versions of the characters, the context of the battle, and how each character's abilities are portrayed. Here are some considerations:\n\n### Godzilla:\n- **Strength and Size**: Godzilla is a gigantic creature with immense physical strength, capable of causing massive destruction with his size alone.\n- **Durability**: Godzilla has shown incredible durability, often withstanding powerful attacks, including nuclear explosions.\n- **Atomic Breath**: One of Godzilla's most iconic abilities is his atomic breath, a powerful energy beam that can cause significant damage.\n- **Regeneration**: In some versions, Godzilla has regenerative abilities, allowing him to recover from injuries quickly.\n\n### Thor (Marvel):\n- **Strength and Combat Skills**: Thor is one of the strongest Avengers and an experienced warrior with centuries of combat experience.\n- **Mjolnir/Stormbreaker**: Thor wields powerful weapons like Mjolnir (or Stormbreaker in some versions), which can summon lightning, create dimensional portals, and deliver devastating blows.\n- **Durability and Healing**: As an Asgardian, Thor has enhanced durability and the ability to heal from injuries faster than humans.\n- **Godly Abilities**: Thor can manipulate weather, summon lightning, and has other godly powers that make him a formidable opponent.\n\n### Hypothetical Battle Analysis:\n- **Initial Clash**: Thor's agility and combat expertise would allow him to dodge some of Godzilla's attacks and deliver powerful strikes. However, Godzilla's sheer size and strength would make it challenging for Thor to cause significant damage initially.\n- **Atomic Breath vs. Lightning**: Godzilla's atomic breath could be countered by Thor's ability to summon lightning. The clash of these two energy-based attacks would be a spectacular sight, with neither easily overpowering the other.\n- **Durability and Endurance**: Both characters have high durability, but Godzilla's regeneration might give him an edge in a prolonged battle. Thor's stamina and godly resilience would be critical in withstanding Godzilla's onslaught.\n- **Environmental Impact**: The battle's location could play a role. In a city, Thor might have an advantage with more maneuverability and potential resources to use. In an open or oceanic environment, Godzilla could leverage his aquatic abilities and massive size more effectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile it's difficult to determine a definitive winner, Thor's versatility, combat skills, and godly powers might give him an edge in a one-on-one fight. However, Godzilla's sheer size, strength, and regenerative abilities make him a nearly unstoppable force. The battle could likely end in a stalemate or be determined by the specific circumstances and environment in which it takes place.",

I've seen more organization in a kindergarten finger painting class. How hard is it to pour coffee and hand out donuts? Apparently impossible for this crew of misfit toys.\n\nThe cleanliness leaves much to be desired - I'm pretty sure some of those tables haven't been wiped down since the Trudeau administration. The first one. Speaking of ancient history, that's about how old the food in the display case looks too.\n\nComplaints fall on deaf ears, assuming you can even find someone pretending to be in charge. I've gotten better customer service from automated phone systems. \n\nIn short, if you're looking for fresh food, quick service, or basic human competence, you'd be better off licking the sidewalk outside.

            "content": "### Star Wars: Shadows in the Purple Garden\n\n#### Chapter 1: The Fall\n\nThe galaxy was plunged into chaos as Order 66 swept across the stars, a devastating directive that aimed to exterminate the Jedi Order. Aayla Secura, a Twi'lek Jedi Master with a reputation for grace, bravery, and wisdom, found herself caught in the maelstrom of betrayal. The clone troopers she had fought beside turned against her, their blasters set to execute. She barely escaped with her life, her heart heavy with the loss of her fellow Jedi and the betrayal of those she once trusted.\n\nWounded and disoriented, Aayla fled to the Outer Rim, seeking refuge in the shadows of less conspicuous worlds. Her journey led her to Zeltros, a planet renowned for its hedonistic lifestyle and vibrant nightlife. Aayla, now assuming the identity of Cera Reval, hoped to disappear among the planet's distractions and pleasures.\n\n#### Chapter 2: A New Identity\n\nMonths passed as Cera Reval integrated herself into the pulsating life of Zeltros. The Purple Garden, one of the planet's most prestigious clubs, became her sanctuary. By day, she worked as a bartender, crafting exotic drinks for a diverse clientele. By night, she danced, her movements a blend of her combat training and the seductive rhythms of Zeltros' nightlife. The club's patrons were captivated by her enigmatic presence, unaware of the Jedi's true identity.\n\nThe once-disciplined Jedi found herself indulging in the decadent offerings of Zeltros. Freed from the rigorous training and ascetic lifestyle of her past, Cera allowed herself to explore the pleasures she had long denied. The rich, flavorful cuisine of the planet became a particular delight, and over time, her once-toned midriff softened into a noticeable gut. The change in her physique was a stark reminder of how far she had strayed from the path of the Jedi.\n\n#### Chapter 3: Whispers in the Dark\n\nOne evening, as the neon lights of The Purple Garden cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the dance floor, Cera noticed a new face among the regular patrons. A tall, hooded figure sat at the bar, their eyes following her every move. Despite the anonymity her new life provided, a sense of unease settled over her. The Force, which she had tried to suppress, whispered a warning.\n\nAs the night wore on, the club's energy reached its peak. Cera, now in her role as a dancer, moved with a fluid grace that belied her worries. The crowd cheered, their voices a cacophony of approval. But the hooded figure remained silent, their gaze fixed and unyielding.\n\nAfter her performance, Cera returned to the bar, her heart pounding not from exertion but from fear. The hooded figure approached, their steps measured and deliberate. She could sense the danger, the dark undertone of their presence.\n\n\"You're a hard woman to find, Aayla Secura,\" the figure said, their voice a low murmur that only she could hear.\n\nCera's blood ran cold. She had been careful, so careful. \"I think you have me mistaken for someone else,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the turmoil within.\n\nThe figure lowered their hood, revealing the face of a former Jedi Padawan, now a hunter in service to the Empire. \"The Inquisitors have been searching for you. Your talent is wasted here, hiding among these hedonists.\"\n\n#### Chapter 4: The Confrontation\n\nAayla's mind raced. The Inquisitors were relentless in their pursuit of Jedi survivors. She had to act quickly. With a subtle gesture, she reached for the Force, feeling its familiar but suppressed embrace. The room seemed to slow as she assessed her surroundings, the exits, and the potential threats.\n\nThe hunter smirked, sensing her intent. \"Do you really think you can escape? The Empire's reach is long, and you're not the warrior you once were.\"\n\nIgnoring the taunt, Aayla focused on the present moment. She had survived Order 66. She could survive this too. In a burst of motion, she vaulted over the bar, her movements a blend of her Jedi agility and the dance routines she had mastered. The patrons gasped, unaware of the true nature of the confrontation unfolding before them.\n\nThe hunter lunged, a red lightsaber igniting with a snap-hiss. Aayla dodged, grabbing a barstool and using it as a makeshift weapon. The duel was fierce, a clash of light and dark amidst the oblivious revelry of The Purple Garden.\n\n#### Chapter 5: A New Path\n\nAs the battle raged, Aayla's determination grew. She could not allow herself to fall here, not after everything she had endured. With a final, decisive move, she disarmed the hunter, sending the red lightsaber clattering across the floor. Her opponent lay defeated, but not dead. Killing was not the Jedi way, even now.\n\nBreathing heavily, Aayla looked around. The patrons were stunned, their illusions of safety shattered. She could not stay on Zeltros any longer. Her identity as Cera Reval had been compromised.\n\nLeaving the club, she slipped into the night, her mind clearer than it had been in months. She had indulged, she had hidden, but she could not deny her true self. The galaxy needed the Jedi, and she was still one of them. Aayla Secura would rise from the shadows and fight once more.\n\n#### Epilogue: The Journey Continues\n\nAayla Secura, now fully embracing her identity, left Zeltros behind. The path ahead was uncertain, fraught with danger. But she knew that she could no longer hide from her destiny. The Force was her guide, and she would follow it, wherever it led.\n\nThe galaxy was vast, and the remnants of the Jedi Order were scattered. But hope remained. Aayla would seek out other survivors, rebuild what had been lost, and continue the fight against the darkness that threatened to consume the stars.\n\nIn the end, the Force would be with her, always.",

            "content": "When using Torchaudio, whether you need to use Librosa depends on your specific requirements. Both Torchaudio and Librosa are popular libraries for audio processing, but they have different strengths and use cases.\n\n### Torchaudio:\n- **Integration with PyTorch:** Torchaudio is designed to work seamlessly with PyTorch, making it ideal if you're working within the PyTorch ecosystem, especially for deep learning tasks.\n- **Efficient Data Loading:** Torchaudio provides efficient I/O operations, supporting various audio formats and enabling direct loading of audio data as tensors.\n- **Transforms and Augmentations:** Torchaudio includes a range of audio processing functions and transformations (e.g., spectrograms, mel-spectrograms, MFCCs) that are optimized for GPU acceleration when used with PyTorch.\n- **On-the-fly Processing:** Since Torchaudio works with PyTorch tensors, it supports on-the-fly processing and can easily be integrated into PyTorch data pipelines.\n\n### Librosa:\n- **Rich Feature Set:** Librosa is a more mature library with a very rich set of features for audio analysis, including advanced time-series analysis, beat tracking, pitch detection, chroma features, and more.\n- **Ease of Use:** Librosa is known for its user-friendly API, making it easy to perform complex audio processing tasks with minimal code.\n- **Visualization:** Librosa integrates well with Matplotlib, making it easier to visualize audio data and features.\n\n### When You Might Need Librosa with Torchaudio:\n- **Advanced Audio Analysis:** If you need advanced audio features that are not available in Torchaudio, such as chromagrams, onset detection, or pitch shifting, you might still want to use Librosa.\n- **Audio Visualization:** Librosa has more tools for visualizing audio, which can be useful for tasks like inspecting waveforms, spectrograms, and other signal features.\n\n### When Torchaudio Alone is Sufficient:\n- **Deep Learning Pipelines:** If your primary goal is to preprocess audio for deep learning models in PyTorch, Torchaudio is often sufficient and more efficient because it avoids the overhead of converting between different data formats.\n- **Basic Audio Processing:** For basic tasks like loading audio, converting to spectrograms, or performing simple augmentations, Torchaudio is well-suited and can handle these tasks efficiently.\n\n### Summary:\nLibrosa is not strictly needed when using Torchaudio, but it can complement Torchaudio if you require advanced audio processing features or more user-friendly visualization tools. If your focus is on integrating audio processing with PyTorch models, Torchaudio is likely sufficient on its own. However, if you need specific features from Librosa, you can certainly use both libraries together in your project.",

Moscow and Saint Petersburg:\n   - 100 rubles (approximately $50) would rent a very good apartment in these Russian cities.\n   - This amount could get you a spacious flat in the city center with modern amenities.\n\n4. Hong Kong:\n   - While specific rental data for 1906 Hong Kong is harder to come by, $50 would have been a significant sum, likely enough for a good-sized apartment in a desirable area.\n   - This would probably be in areas populated by expatriates and wealthy locals.\n\nIn all these cities, $50 would have been at the higher end of the rental market, suitable for upper-middle-class professionals or wealthy individuals. It would have secured comfortable living quarters with good amenities by the standards of the time.\n\nIt's important to note that in some of these cities, especially in Europe, long-term leases or different rental structures were common, which could affect monthly rates. Also, the exact exchange rates fluctuated, which could slightly alter the purchasing power in each city.",

In fact, it would likely have been sufficient for an entire bespoke suit of excellent quality. Here's some context:\n\n1. Price range: In the early 1900s, a good quality ready-made suit typically cost between $10 and $30. \n\n2. Made-to-measure and bespoke: These custom options were more expensive, but even the finest bespoke suits from top tailors rarely exceeded $50-$75 for a complete suit.\n\n3. Quality: For $50, you could expect a suit jacket (or a full suit) made from high-quality materials like fine wool, with excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\n4. Tailoring: This price would cover the services of a skilled tailor, including multiple fittings to ensure a perfect fit.\n\n5. Extras: The price might also include high-quality linings, buttons, and other details that would make the jacket stand out.\n\n6. Comparison to ready-made: A $50 made-to-measure jacket would be significantly superior in fit, material, and overall quality compared to off-the-rack options.\n\n7. International perspective: Even in major fashion centers like London or Paris, $50 would secure a very fine made-to-measure jacket or suit.\n\nIt's worth noting that $50 was a substantial amount for clothing at the time. Many working-class individuals might only spend $10-$15 on an entire suit, so a $50 jacket would have been considered a luxury item, associated with the upper-middle class or wealthy individuals.",

This social norm was quite strong and prevalent in Western societies. Here are some key points about this custom:\n\n1. Social expectation: Wearing a hat was seen as a mark of respectability and a necessary part of a complete outfit for men.\n\n2. Class and status: The type of hat often indicated a man's social class and occupation.\n\n3. Etiquette: There were detailed rules about when and how to wear hats, including when to remove them (e.g., indoors, in the presence of ladies, during national anthems).\n\n4. Variety: Different types of hats were appropriate for different occasions and times of day. Common styles included fedoras, bowlers, homburgs, and flat caps.\n\n5. Weather protection: Hats served a practical purpose, protecting from sun, rain, and cold.\n\n6. All classes: While the quality and style might differ, the expectation of wearing a hat applied across social classes.\n\n7. Gradual change: This norm began to shift in the mid-20th century, with hatless men becoming more common in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n8. Regional variations: While this was a widespread norm in Europe and North America, the specific expectations could vary in different cultures and climates.\n\n9. Exceptions: There were some situations where not wearing a hat was acceptable, such as during certain sports or physical labor.\n\nThe expectation was so ingrained that a man without a hat might be viewed as forgetful, poorly dressed, or even of questionable character. This social norm reflected the more formal and structured nature of society at that time, where adherence to dress codes was seen as important for maintaining social order and respectability.",

This means it had significantly more buying power. \n* **Average Income:** The average annual income in the United States around 1906 was between $200 and $400. So, $50 represented about **12.5% to 25% of a year's earnings** for the average person.\n* **Cost of Living:**  Here are some examples of what $50 could buy in 1906:\n    * A month or two of rent for a basic apartment\n    * A decent used horse\n    * Several months worth of groceries for a family\n    * A new suit of clothes and a pair of shoes \n    * A train ticket from New York to Chicago\n\n**In conclusion:** $50 in 1906 was a considerable amount of money, representing a significant expense or investment for the average person.",

This wouldn't be a fancy address, and amenities would be minimal. Here's a glimpse of what you might get:\n\n* **Location:** You'd likely be in a working-class neighborhood, perhaps near factories or businesses where tenants worked. It wouldn't be the most desirable area and could be crowded or lack green spaces.\n* **Size:** Don't expect spacious living! You'd be looking at a few small rooms, perhaps two or three at most. It might be a railroad-style apartment, where rooms are connected in a line.\n* **Amenities:**  Indoor plumbing was becoming more common, so you might have a toilet and possibly a bathtub inside the apartment. However, shared bathrooms in the hallway were still prevalent. A kitchen might be a small alcove with a stove, but no refrigerator. \n* **Condition:**  Buildings from that era were often poorly maintained, with issues like drafts, limited lighting, and basic construction. Don't expect modern conveniences like central heating or air conditioning.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* In New York City, $50 might get you a tenement apartment in the Lower East Side, known for being cramped and often lacking proper ventilation.\n* In a smaller Midwestern city, you might find a slightly larger apartment above a shop or in a multi-family house, but still with basic amenities.\n\n**Important Note:** Prices varied greatly depending on the city and neighborhood. Wealthier areas would command much higher rents, even for modest accommodations.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n**London & Paris:**\n\n* $50 would have been a low-to-mid range rent in working-class areas of these cities. You could likely find a small, basic apartment, but it might be in a less desirable neighborhood with limited amenities. \n* In more central or affluent areas, $50 wouldn't have gotten you much, and you would have likely needed to find a roommate or compromise on space and quality.\n\n**Moscow & St. Petersburg:**\n\n* Information on historical rents in Russia is harder to come by. However, considering the political and economic climate of the time, $50 might have secured a decent apartment in a working-class neighborhood. \n* Keep in mind that living standards and housing conditions varied greatly in pre-revolutionary Russia.\n\n**Hong Kong:**\n\n* Hong Kong in 1906 was a densely populated British colony. $50 might have rented a small room or basic apartment in a tenement building, likely with shared facilities.  \n* Living conditions in these tenements could be cramped and challenging.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Exchange Rates:** Currency conversions from 1906 are complex. It's more useful to think of purchasing power.  $50 was a significant sum in the US then, but it might not translate to the same level of housing in cities with different economies and cost of living.\n* **Neighborhood:** Costs varied drastically by location. A central, fashionable area would be far more expensive than a working-class suburb.\n* **Expectations:**  \"Apartment\" meant different things then. Shared facilities, outdoor toilets, and basic construction were common even in relatively expensive cities.\n\n**In conclusion:** While you might have found some form of housing for $50 per month in these cities, it would have likely been basic, small, and located in a less desirable area.  Finding a comfortable and spacious apartment would have required a significantly higher budget.",

            "content": "$50 in 1906 could have potentially gotten you a very nice made-to-measure suit jacket, but it would have depended on a few key factors:\n\n**Factors Affecting Price:**\n\n* **Location:** Tailoring prices, like most things, varied by location. Big cities with renowned tailors would be more expensive than smaller towns.\n* **Fabric:** The type of fabric was a major price determinant. Simple wool blends were affordable, while luxurious fabrics like high-grade wool, cashmere, or silk would drastically increase the cost. \n* **Tailor's Prestige:** A well-known and highly skilled tailor would charge more for their expertise and reputation.\n* **Details and Extras:**  Adding extra details like multiple pockets, intricate stitching, or a particularly fashionable cut would all add to the price.\n\n**What You Could Get:**\n\n* **Basic but Good Quality:**  For $50, you could likely get a well-made suit jacket from a reputable but not top-tier tailor, using a decent quality wool fabric. It might not have had the most fashionable cut or luxurious lining, but it would have been durable and well-fitting.\n* **Compromises:** To afford a jacket made with finer fabric or from a more prestigious tailor, you might have to compromise on some extras or opt for a simpler design.\n* **Secondhand Option:** Another possibility is that $50 could have purchased a high-quality secondhand jacket, perhaps even previously owned by someone wealthy.\n\n**In Conclusion:** While a top-of-the-line, custom-made suit jacket from the most sought-after tailor would have cost significantly more than $50 in 1906, a well-made, good quality jacket would have been attainable with that budget, especially with careful choices and perhaps a bit of bargain hunting.",

In Western cultures, particularly in the US and Europe, it was considered quite scandalous for a man to be outside without a hat in 1906. \n\nHere's why hats were so important:\n\n* **Social Status & Decorum:** Hats were a key indicator of social standing. Different styles signified different classes and professions. Going hatless could be seen as a sign of disrespect to oneself and to society's norms. \n* **Nakedness Taboo:**  It sounds strange now, but going bareheaded was equated with a kind of public undress. Hats, especially for men, were considered almost an extension of their clothing.\n* **Protection & Practicality:** Hats provided shade from the sun, warmth in colder weather, and protection from dust or rain. This was especially important in an era before widespread car ownership.\n\nExceptions to the Rule:\n\n* **Young Boys:**  Very young boys were often exempt from this strict hat etiquette.\n* **Inside Homes:** Men typically removed their hats indoors, especially in private homes, as a sign of respect.\n* **Certain Activities:**  Hats might be removed during strenuous physical activity or in informal settings like a beach or park.\n\nThe Decline of Hats:\n\nThe tradition of men wearing hats began to decline in the decades following World War I  (1914-1918). Factors that contributed to this shift include:\n\n* **Casualization of Dress:**  Overall, clothing became less formal.\n* **Rise of the Automobile:**  Cars provided protection from the elements, reducing the practical need for hats.\n* **Changing Hairstyles:**  Men started wearing their hair shorter, making hats less necessary.\n\nSo, while it might seem strange today, in 1906, a man without a hat would have definitely raised eyebrows and been seen as breaking a strong social convention!",

Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. **Incumbency Advantage**: Historically, incumbent presidents have a higher chance of being re-elected. However, this can be influenced by the current administration's approval ratings and economic conditions.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators**: The state of the economy often plays a crucial role. Positive economic growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation can favor the incumbent party.\n\n3. **Approval Ratings**: The approval ratings of the sitting president and the general sentiment towards the administration's performance can significantly impact election outcomes.\n\n4. **Party Loyalty and Polarization**: The level of party loyalty and polarization can affect voter turnout and sway undecided voters.\n\n5. **Demographic Changes**: Shifts in demographic trends, such as the growing influence of younger and more diverse voters, can impact electoral outcomes.\n\n6. **Key Swing States**: Trends and polling in key swing states are critical. States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and Arizona often play decisive roles.\n\n7. **Candidate Quality**: The appeal and electability of the candidates, including their ability to connect with voters and articulate their vision, are important.\n\n8. **Major Events**: Unexpected events, such as political scandals, international conflicts, or significant policy achievements, can shift voter sentiment.\n\nGiven these factors, it's essential to consider the political landscape as it unfolds closer to the election date. Historical trends provide some insights, but the dynamic nature of politics means that outcomes can be unpredictable. As of now, without specific data from 2024, it's difficult to definitively predict the winner.",

The number \"45\" would be visible somewhere on the cake or in the image, possibly as candles on top of the cake or written in icing on the side.
